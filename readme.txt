da_pb_closed is the migration flow, from orig to dest, so quite a nice little matrix we can reasonably deal with? The OECD also publishes the data but this data set was smaller cleaner easier, so why not. A long way down the road once we get our models set up, and this data modelled, we can start adding things from these kinds of places?
